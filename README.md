# shield-bank
This is my project on building a banking platform using C#

## New Bank
This is the console Application of the bank application. It makes use of class libraries in different namespaces and an E-memory database

##BankAppUI
This is the first use of winforms which provides the bank application a User Interface. Microsoft SQL Database was also used.

##Shield Bank
This is a better designed interface with more functionalities provided for both the Administrator and Customer and a single point of entry.
